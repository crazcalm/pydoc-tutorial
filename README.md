How to use pydoc to document your application.


## Basic Usage:
* pydoc -h
    * This command will provide you with      

* pydoc python_file
    * This command will generate terminal documentation for that file. This
      is similar using help to look up python documentation in the interactive terminal.
      
* pydoc -w python_file
    * This command will generate an html file of the documentation.
    * Note: The html is UGLY! 
      
      
## Test it Out:
1. git clone 
2. cd into repository
3. pydoc program

## Screenshots:
    Screenshots of both the terminal and the html version of the documentation
    can be found in the img directory.
